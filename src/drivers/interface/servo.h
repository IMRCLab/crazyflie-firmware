 * Servo.h - Servo motor driver header file (based on motors.h & piezo.h)
 *
 * The motors PWM ratio is a value on 16 bits (from 0 to 0xFFFF)
 * the functions of the driver will make the conversions to the actual PWM
 * precision (ie. if the precision is 8bits 0xFFFF and 0xFF00 are equivalents).
 *
 * The precision is set in number of bits by the define MOTORS_PWM_BITS
 * The timer prescaler is set by MOTORS_PWM_PRESCALE
